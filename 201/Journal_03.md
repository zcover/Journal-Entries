# Journal 3
## Goals:
### - One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

>“For adult learners, their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning.”

### - In other words, your life experience in learning the things you did before learning code will make this new experience more meaningful for you, and reflection on all of your experiences is essential in maximizing what you can gain from your study at Code Fellows. How do you think your prior life and professional experience will help you in this new endeavor?

## Growth Mindset and Fixed Mindset
> #### We have both Growth and Fixed Mindset's in our lives. We are not strictly one or the other in our thought-process, but actively live both, everchanging.

### Being a Software Developer
- We need to be able to learn how to do anything, constantly improving, striving to *learn all you can* from **all** resources, and *teach others what **you** know*.

## CSS
### Box Model
>Margin is all the wall space around everything
    >> border Is the _frame_ around the content
    >>> Padding Separates the content from the border
    >>>> The Content (text, image, whatever~)

## JS
### Arrays
- try to always think of _for_ loops when you need, or have need for an Array
<br>

        myPets = ['Tangerine', 'Malaki', 'Cookie'];
        
        console.log(myPets);
        >Tangerine
        >Malaki
        >Cookie

        console.log(myPets[0]);
        >Tangerine
## JS Control Flow

### if/else
    if(condition){
        do something
    } else {
        do something else
    }
### while
    while (condition){
        do something
    }
    <!-- does thing until condition is met -->

### for
    for (a set number of times){
        do the thing
    }
    <!-- repeats # of times -->
<br>

## Cool things useful for loops

### % _(mod)_ 
    if(i % 2 === 0)
    >This states that _if_ **_i_** is devided by **2**, and has a remainder of exactly 0, _do the thing_
