## Audio/Video
### Audio

    <audio src="link.mp3" controls> </audio>
Very simple since HTML 5, and there is an autoplay option, but most browsers block it by default (which is good.)

### Video

    <video id="sun" src="video.mp4" width="30%" conrols poster='thumbnail.jpg></video>
Videos are also really simple. They allow you to enter width or height options within the html, and again, the autoplay is available, but not really useful.

* *Note that you can use in-line styling tools for both of these, but it is always recommended to style in CSS.
