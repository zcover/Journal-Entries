_url files_<br>
Copies the code base from a location that the code has been pre typed for us, and is used for your code to run off of it.

    //URL code is entered in the script tag of the html
    <script
    src = https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@2.8.0/dist/Chart.min.js></script>

    <script src = "app.js"></script>
* Note that the script is above your own code, due to the top -> bottom nature of HTML, and your code relies on that code to run.
