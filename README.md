# Journal Entry Day 1



### Seperation of concerns
    Separating different aspects to seperate locations
    - Although HTML can style things, we keep CSS, HTML, and Javascript seperate


### HTML 

- We name our homepage _index.html_ because browsers are programed to look for a file named index, and treat it ast the homepage

 - Styled by inserting
 <script>
    //js
</script>
